<h2 class="title" id="poem-01"><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>As in a Rose-Jar</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>As in a rose-jar filled with petals sweet</p>
		<p class="i2">Blown long ago in some old garden place,</p>
		<p class="i2">Mayhap, where you and I, a little space,</p>
		<p>Drank deep of love and knew that love was fleet—</p>
		<p>Or leaves once gathered from a lost retreat</p>
		<p class="i2">By one who never will again retrace</p>
		<p class="i2">Her silent footsteps—one, whose gentle face</p>
		<p>Was fairer than the roses at her feet;</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>So, deep within the vase of memory,</p>
		<p class="i2">I keep my dust of roses fresh and dear</p>
		<p class="i4">As in the days before I knew the smart</p>
		<p>Of time and death. Nor aught can take from me</p>
		<p class="i2">The haunting fragrance that still lingers here—</p>
		<p class="i4">As in a rose-jar, so within my heart!</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-02"><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>The Island</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>There is an island in the silent sea,</p>
		<p>Whose marge the wistful waves lap listlessly—</p>
		<p>An isle of rest for those who used to be.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>For ne’er an echo wakes that towering wall,</p>
		<p>Whose blackened crags answer none other call</p>
		<p>Save the lone ocean’s rhythmic rise and fall.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Only the song the sea sings as she laves</p>
		<p>That sleep-bound shore with sad caressing waves,</p>
		<p>The while the dead sleep sweeter in their graves.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>’Tis oh! so still they sleep within each tomb,</p>
		<p>Cool in long shadows of the cypress gloom,</p>
		<p>Breathing in death the moon-flower’s rank perfume.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>They know not when slow barges on the mere</p>
		<p>Enter the portals of that place austere—</p>
		<p>Enter and so forever disappear!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And in this island of a silent sea,</p>
		<p>Whose marge e’er wistful waves lap listlessly,</p>
		<p>Is rest,—is peace for all eternity.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-03"><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>You and I</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Over the hills where the pine-trees grow,</p>
		<p class="i2">With a laugh to answer the wind at play.</p>
		<p>Why do I laugh? I do not know,</p>
		<p class="i2">But you and I once passed this way.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Down in the hollow now white with snow</p>
		<p class="i2">My heart is singing a song today.</p>
		<p>Why do I sing? I do not know,</p>
		<p class="i2">But you and I were here in May.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-04"><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>A Ballade of Old Romance</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>When April spreads her mantle green</p>
		<p class="i2">Across the pasture-lands of snow,</p>
		<p>And Spring’s first scarlet breasts are seen</p>
		<p class="i2">Where treetops rustle to and fro;</p>
		<p class="i2">Then come fair fragrant dreams as though</p>
		<p>Our lightest fancy to entrance</p>
		<p class="i2">And paint us what we fain would know</p>
		<p>Adown the lanes of Old Romance.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Anon, we see the golden sheen</p>
		<p class="i2">Of burnished mail the sunbeams throw,</p>
		<p>Flashing the poplars tall between,</p>
		<p class="i2">As knights ride by to meet the foe;</p>
		<p class="i2">Or, mayhap, shepherd lads who blow</p>
		<p>On slender pipes, a pastoral dance—</p>
		<p class="i2">Ah, strong were they in weal and woe</p>
		<p>Adown the lanes of Old Romance!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>But now the vast years intervene,</p>
		<p class="i2">The fountain long has ceased its flow,</p>
		<p>And silence rules the lone demesne</p>
		<p class="i2">That once held such a goodly show;</p>
		<p class="i2">Yet time, at least, does this bestow</p>
		<p>Nor leave the best to fleeting chance—</p>
		<p class="i2">They live again in fancy’s glow</p>
		<p>Adown the lanes of Old Romance.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="cen">ENVOY</p>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Sweet, still for us some blossoms grow</p>
		<p class="i2">From out that dim and dear expanse—</p>
		<p>Come, take my hand and we shall go</p>
		<p class="i2">Adown the lanes of Old Romance!</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-05"><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>A Voice From the Far Away</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>I heard a voice from the far away</p>
		<p class="i2">Softly say this to me—</p>
		<p>“You will find the heart of the world some day</p>
		<p class="i2">And the why of the things that be;</p>
		<p>You will see the grief of the yea and nay</p>
		<p class="i2">And the price of frailty.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>“And upon your lute you will weave a theme</p>
		<p class="i2">Which the world will harken and know;</p>
		<p>For every note of the song will teem</p>
		<p class="i2">With a great soul’s overflow—</p>
		<p>You will speak the meaning within a dream</p>
		<p class="i2">And the pain in the afterglow.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>“But for all of this there’s a price—</p>
		<p class="i2">’Tis the price of minstrelsy—</p>
		<p>You will never have of the things you play,</p>
		<p class="i2">Sad singer of poetry,</p>
		<p>And throughout your life you will go for aye,</p>
		<p class="i2">Heart-hungry and silently!”</p>
		<p>I heard a voice from the far away</p>
		<p class="i2">Softly say this to me.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-06"><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>April</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Throughout the vale again Narcissus cries</p>
		<p class="i2">And Echo answers from her dark retreat,</p>
		<p class="i2">While Zephyr heavy-laden with the sweet,</p>
		<p>Fresh scent of blooms across the pasture hies;</p>
		<p>Above, the blueness of the April skies,</p>
		<p class="i2">Matched by the lure unto the wandering feet</p>
		<p class="i2">That e’er must go ere Spring could be complete</p>
		<p>To the green wood where laughing Eros lies.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>O April lover, hear the pipes that call,</p>
		<p class="i2">The pipes of Pan a-blowing lustily,</p>
		<p class="i4">They call to you and me, and he who hears</p>
		<p>Must ever after be Young April’s thrall—</p>
		<p class="i2">So, faring thus together, we shall see</p>
		<p class="i4">The Islands of the Blest between the Spheres!</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-07"><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>A Yesterday</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>I held you in my arms—so happy I,</p>
		<p>Who quite forgot the while that moments fly;</p>
		<p>Nor ever dreamed that they could pass away,</p>
		<p class="i4">Till it was yesterday.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Yet, just because that hour was long ago</p>
		<p>And seems to me so near—well, this I know</p>
		<p>That sometime I shall clasp your hand and say:</p>
		<p class="i4">Was there a yesterday?</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-08"><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>Violets</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>’Twas just at sundown, when the leaves were wet</p>
		<p class="i12">With evening dew,</p>
		<p>Far in the fields where sky and violet</p>
		<p class="i12">Blend rifts of blue—</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>But for a moment, deep among the flowers</p>
		<p class="i12">And rain-sweet grass,</p>
		<p>I saw her—loved her—and as April showers</p>
		<p class="i12">Beheld her pass.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>O, the lone vastness of the afterglow,</p>
		<p class="i12">Unknown before;</p>
		<p>Shall e’er I see that face where violets grow,</p>
		<p class="i12">Perchance, once more!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Yet no one comes save night, with wild regrets</p>
		<p class="i12">And silent pain—</p>
		<p>Only sometimes the scent of violets</p>
		<p class="i12">On wind-blown rain.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class="title" id="poem-09"><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>A Song of Life</h2>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i6"><em>What if the song is sung, I say,</em></p>
		<p class="i6"><em>As long as the song was sung!</em></p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Did we not meet with the blood’s best play</p>
		<p>The lash of the winds and the rain that stung,</p>
		<p>And the tang of the salty spray?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Did we not drink the last drop that clung</p>
		<p>To the golden bowl with its glowing fire,</p>
		<p>Yet so cool to our burning tongue?</p>
	</div>

		<p>A twisted back, a face year-scarred and grim,</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
